# CS480 Project Notebooks

The following two notebooks implement the CNNs for counterfeit Pokemon card detection for the CS 480 project by Bahaa Desoky (b2desoky@uwaterloo.ca)

- project_b2desoky.ipynb: The custom CNN model
- project_b2desoky_pretrained.ipynb: The pretrained CNN model

Both notebooks also have all of the GradCam visualization images for the entire test dataset near the bottom. The image dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ongshujian/real-and-fake-pokemon-cards

Do not distribute or use, this repository is public so that the CS 480 instructor can view it.
